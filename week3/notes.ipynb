    "# Recurrent Neural Networks for time series\n",
    "RNN is a neural network that contains recurrent layers, design to consequently process sequence of inputs.\n",
    "With RNN we can feed in a batch of sequences and it will output a batch of forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference from previous NN is that input shape is 3-dimensional: batch size, time steps, dimensionality of inputs at each time step.\n",
    "At each time step `i` memory cell takes the input value for that step and state input, and then calculates the output of that step (`Yi`) and state factor (`Hi`), which is then feed into the next memory cell.\n",
    "Values recur due to the output of the cell at one step being fed back into itself at the next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Recurrent Layer](./recurrent_layer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shape of the inputs to the RNN\n",
    "The inputs are 3-dimensional. For example if we have a window size of 30 timesteps and we are batching them in sizes of 4, the shape would be 4x30x1.\n",
    "At each timestep the memory cell input (`Xi`) will be a 4x1 matrix. The memory cell will output the `Hi` value aka state matrix.\n",
    "Cell will also output a `Yi` value. If the memory cell is comprised of 3 neurons, then the output matrix will be 4x3 because batch size was 4 and a number of neurons is 3.\n",
    "So the whole output of the neuron is 3-dimensional, in this case: 4x30x3. With 4 being the batch size, 3 being a number of units and 30 being a number of overall steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple RNN the state output of H is just the copy of output matrix Y (e.g. H0 is a copy of Y0, H1 is a copy of Y1 adn so on).\n",
    "At each step the memory cell gets both the current input Xi and also the previous output Yi.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence-to-Vector\n",
    "In some cases you want to input a sequence, but you do not want a sequence as an on output. This is called a `Sequence-to-Vector` RNN.\n",
    "In reality all you do is just ignore all previous output values of Y except the last one (e.g. Y29). In TF this is a default behaviour, otherwise you have to specify `return_sequences=true` to make layer return a sequence.\n",
